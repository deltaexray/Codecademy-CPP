/*
Had to read and rethink it almost 20times, 'cause for me the doubling of the "u's and e's" was to be done after the actuall loop. 
Until I read the instructions again and noticed, something wasn't working. 
Also: With getline, u can now input everything you want. So Yeah. good learning Experience. */
